Hi,

Was unable to do the challenges due to issues with the AWS. Nonetheless, 

1. The boot camp was useful as it re-enforce the stuff I has learnt.
2. The security portion was of least familiar. I'm more familiar with CM/CDH installation.
3. The security was helpful.
4. About 2 months to understand more about the security portion.



Thanks alot.
